# 🧠 LLM Playground

Welcome to the **LLM Playground** — a personal repository where I experiment with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and explore how they can solve **real-world problems** through smart prompting, tool integration, and system design.

## 🚀 Goal

The primary focus of this repo is to:

- Explore and test the capabilities of different LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc.)
- Design and build use cases ranging from **basic prototypes** to **advanced multi-agent systems**
- Document learnings, failures, and patterns along the way

This will be a continuously evolving space — I'll be adding use cases **as long as my API quota survives... 😅**

## 📌 What's Inside?

- ✅ Basic LLM interactions and prompts
- ✅ Use case-driven experiments (e.g., AI tutor, resume reviewer, content generator)
- ✅ Tools and APIs integration (e.g., vector databases, LangChain, LangGraph, etc.)
- ✅ Agentic workflows and multi-step reasoning
- ✅ GenAI experiments (DALL·E, Imagen, Stable Diffusion)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- OpenAI, Gemini, Claude APIs
- LangChain, LangGraph, Hugging Face
- FAISS, Weaviate
- Streamlit, Flask (for UI)
- AWS/GCP (for hosting, if needed)

## 🌱 Why This Repository?

As the AI world shifts rapidly toward **autonomous, agentic, and multimodal systems**, I aim to not just use LLMs, but **build novel and research-driven applications** using them. This is my way of learning, contributing, and sharing that journey.
